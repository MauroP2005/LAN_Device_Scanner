A Python tool that scans your local network and lists all connected devices. Useful for identifying unknown devices, auditing your home or office network, or learning how subnet scanning works.

> This was my first full GitHub project â€” built to learn Python scripting, network scanning, and real-world version control workflows.
---

## Features

- Detects your local IP address and subnet mask
- Calculates your network's CIDR range (e.g. `192.168.1.0/24`)
- Scans all devices on the subnet using multithreaded ping
- Resolves hostnames via reverse DNS
- Exports results to `scan_results.csv`
- Handles unreachable hostnames safely (no crashes)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `psutil` package

### Install requirements:
```bash
pip install psutil
